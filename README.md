Here I am introducing my Portfolio page to you. There is very little information as I do not have anything to add to it, yet! The index.html page consist of a article about who I am, and what I enjoy. The portfolio.html does not contain any projects at the moment, but does have pictures of me with my family and those I love. The contact.html is self-explantory, but is not functional. 

There is one issue I cannot figure out, and that is the having the footer be responsive. It may look or be buggy when resizing the browser.
